### Project Title
Bikeshare project for Udacity Data Analytics nanodegree.

### Description
I have personally used the Blue Bikes in New Orleans and Fly (scooters) in Austin. It was always interesting to understand how companies use data to determine where to focus their business. 
This project looks at Chicago, New York City, and Washington bike information including trip start and stop stations, duration of journey, user stats.

The outputs of the program include (1) location stats, (2) duration and (3) user stats:

(1) popular month, day of week, hour, start station, end station, frequent combination of start and end stations
(2) mean travel time, earliest, most recent
(3) general and common year of birth.

### Files used
Files used include:
chicago.csv
new_york_city.csv
washington.csv
Note that the Washington excel file does not include data on user gender or birth year
